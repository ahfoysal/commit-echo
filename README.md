# commit-echo

LLM-powered CLI that learns your Git commit style and auto-suggests personalized commit messages.

## Features

- **Style learning** — Adapts to your commit conventions over time by analyzing your history
- **Multi-provider** — Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- **Interactive setup** — Guided wizard to configure your provider and model
- **Non-destructive** — Review and edit suggestions before committing

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @404-pf/commit-echo
```

## Development

To build and run the CLI locally without a global install:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js suggest
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full setup and contribution workflow.

## Usage

```bash
# Full flow: diff, suggest, pick, commit
commit-echo

# Auto-accept and commit first suggestion
commit-echo --yes

# Interactive setup wizard
commit-echo init

# Generate suggestions without committing
commit-echo suggest

# Auto-select first suggestion (no commit)
commit-echo suggest --yes

# View learned style profile
commit-echo history
```

Note: The non-interactive flags `--yes`, `-y`, and `--auto` expect staged changes (run `git add`). If no staged changes are found when auto-committing is requested, the command will print an error and exit with a non-zero status.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 24.0.0
- A Git repository with staged changes
- An API key for your chosen LLM provider

## Configuration

Run `commit-echo init` to configure your provider and model. Configuration is stored in `~/.config/commit-echo/config.json`.

### Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `provider` | — | LLM provider key (e.g., `openai`, `anthropic`, `ollama`) |
| `model` | — | Model name to use for generation |
| `historySize` | `50` | Number of recent commits to learn style from |
| `maxDiffSize` | `4000` | Maximum diff size (in characters) sent to the LLM. Diffs exceeding this limit are intelligently truncated — file headers are preserved while line-level content is dropped from overflow files. Adjust upward for large refactors or generated-file changes. |

### Custom Prompt Templates

You can override the built-in system and user prompts by setting `systemPromptTemplate` and/or `userPromptTemplate` in `config.json`. This is useful for enforcing project-specific commit conventions (e.g., Jira ticket prefixes, Gerrit Change-Id footers, Signed-off-by lines).

Run `commit-echo init` and answer "Yes" when asked about custom prompt templates, or edit `config.json` directly:

```json
{
  "systemPromptTemplate": "You are a commit assistant for the Acme project.\nAlways include a Jira ticket reference.\n\n{{profile}}",
  "userPromptTemplate": "Generate 3 conventional commits for this diff on branch {{branch}}:\n\n{{diff}}"
}
```

#### Template Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{{diff}}` | The git diff text |
| `{{profile}}` | The learned style profile summary |
| `{{branch}}` | Current git branch name |
| `{{message}}` | *(reserved)* Previous commit message context |

If a custom template is not set, the built-in prompt is used as a fallback.

## Quickstart

### Environment

Set the API key for the provider you plan to use before running the setup wizard or generating suggestions:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-example
# or
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-example
```

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-example"
# or
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-example"
```

```cmd
set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-example
REM or
set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-example
```

### Full flow: review staged changes and commit

```bash
git add .
commit-echo
```

Sample output:

```text
commit-echo
  1. feat: add release summary command
  2. fix: guard empty commit history
  3. docs: clarify init workflow
```

### Interactive setup

```bash
commit-echo init
```

What it does:
- lets you pick a provider
- helps you choose a model
- saves the config to `~/.config/commit-echo/config.json`

### Generate suggestions without committing

```bash
commit-echo suggest --no-commit
```

Sample output:

```text
Suggestions generated:
  1. fix: handle empty staged diff
  2. test: cover custom provider validation
  3. chore: refresh package metadata
```

### View learned style history

```bash
commit-echo history
```

Sample output:

```text
Recent commit style
- prefix frequency: fix, feat, docs
- average subject length: 42
- recent bodies: 6
```

## Troubleshooting

- **`No configuration found`** — run `commit-echo init` first.
- **`No changes detected`** — stage files with `git add` or make an unstaged edit before running `commit-echo suggest`.
- **Provider auth errors** — confirm the matching environment variable (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or your custom provider key) is set in the same shell session.
- **Wrong repository context** — run the command inside a Git repository so `commit-echo` can read the diff and history.
